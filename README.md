# create-mytech

`create-mytech` is a CLI tool designed to generate a boilerplate MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) codebase, helping developers quickly scaffold a fully functional project structure with essential files, directories, and optionally installed dependencies.

## Features

-   Generates a complete MERN project structure with separate `server` and `client` folders.
-   Creates necessary configuration files, like `package.json`, `.env`, and `globals.css`.
-   Prompts the user to optionally install project dependencies for both backend and frontend.

## Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
-   **npm** or **yarn**

## Installation

You can use `npx` or `npm create` to run `create-mytech` without needing to install it globally.

### Using npx

```bash
npx create-mytech
```
